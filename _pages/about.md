Hello and welcome to my digital space! I'm Alex, and this website serves as a dynamic platform where my professional journey unfolds. Whether you're a potential employer, a colleague, or someone with a shared passion for data and insights, I'm thrilled to have you here.

On this site, you'll find my up-to-date curriculum vitae, detailing my educational background, work experience, and the skills that define my professional profile.

Addionally I plan to release some projects that I am working on currently. You can find an excerpt of my work in the blog posts section.

Always feel free to contact me on any of my socials or mail.
